# Food-Vision üçïüç∞

A Deep Learning Model which can classify 100+ classes of Food Images, Made with Transfer Learning - EfficientNetB0)

Used ResNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 as base models and got better results for EfficientNetB0. So, continued fine tunig for EfficientNet Model.

### We actually got an accuracy of nearly 80% for 100+ classes, Pretty cool isn't it?

## Steps to run the App
1. Clone the repo
2. cd Food-Vision
3. streamlit run app.py
4. Upload a food image (from the 100 classes to get correct predicitions)
5. Now u'll be able to see the prediciton
6. Btw, don't forget to download the dependencies/requirements (pip install tensorflow streamlit matplotlib numpy)
